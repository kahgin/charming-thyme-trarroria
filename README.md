# Charming Thyme Trarroria's Management System

Charming Thyme Trattoria is an extremely famous fine-dining restaurant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The restaurant always strives to provide the best fine-dining cuisine in the Kuala Lumpur area. Due to popular demand, guests are required to make a reservation to enjoy a meal at the restaurant.

Hence, in a group of four, we developed a restaurant management system for the restaurant using the Python 3 programming language. The focus of the management system is to process all the reservation data based on staff's interface. However, it also has the option to generate random dish recommendations if the guests are looking for an adventure and request to be surprised.
